# RDAMP-Sales-Analysis

## Approach
I used Excel to firstly clean the datasets:
* Corrected the regions to the cities using Vlookups
* Identified segments and categories for products
* Identified and filtered out data errors

Then used pivot tables to aggregate the data to the tasks assigned.

Finally, generated graphs to visualise insights in certain periods/regions and product categories.

The data and analysis is available in "Michael Petinou Sales Report RDAMP.xlsx"

## Insights

### Profitable Products by Region
The highest profits are a result of sales in kitchen and clothing products.

From these graphs you can easily see which regions have the highest and lowest profit margins per product category.

* Yorkshire & The Humber and Scotland are the regions with the highest profits related to Kitchen products.
* The regions North East and Wales have significantly the lowest profits related to Kitchen products in comparison to the other available regions.
* Recommendations for investors would be to invest in companies supplying kitchen products within the regions of Yorkshire & the Humber and Scotland.

* London and Yorkshire & the Humber have the highest sum of profits related to Clothing products amongst the available regions
* Similarly to the kitchen products, the regions Wales and North East hold for the lowest sum of profits related to Clothing products
* Recommendations for investors would be to invest into clothing companies within the regions of London and Yorkshire & the Humber due to their higher profit margins.

### Profitable Months of the Year

Again taking the highest performing product categories, we can see how profits change through the months.

* The months March and August produced the highest profit margins related to kitchen sales 
* Whilst May and July had the lowest profit margins.

* March marks the beginning of spring cleaning season so consumers are motivated to re-organise and upgrade their kitchen space. As demand will spike in this time, consumers will purchase at retail price without discounts, thus leading to maximum profits.
* August is the time where households will purchase back-to-school bundles for their kids moving out and heading back to college or university so demand for bundled sets of kitchen products will rapidly increase in demand, thus high profits in this month.

* January is the month with the highest profit margins related to clothing products and June and November hold for the months with the lowest profit margins.
* This could be caused by post-holiday trends like people spending their gift-cards, and taking advantage of seasonal discounts available after Christmas time.

## Order Mode

Users have the option to order in-store as well as online.
This graph illustrates the proportion of orders by both these modes for each of the regions.

* The majority of the regions hold around 50% preference when either ordering online or in-store.
* Northern Ireland holds a dominant preference for online purchasing over in-store purchasing.  Closely behind is North East with a 39% rate if in-store purchasing compared to its 61% of online purchasing.
* The regions with the highest in store purchasing rates are Wales with the highest and East Midlands closely following. Reasons for this could be older demographics in these regions and limited access to internet/ slower network speeds making it better to go in-store to purchase.
